- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
The log is being produced without sanitizing the user inputs. This can lead to code injection and potentially information disclosure.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We should store the log in a more secure and persistent form. Simply having the log be a variable within the application does not ensure longetivy of our log. We can also implement some automated auditing procedures to actually check the contents of our logs.
