- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The vulnerability lies in the fact that we are directly using the id provided by the user without a try/catch block. This enables the user to pass an id input that will result in a faulty operation by MongoDB. The secure version prevents this vulnerability by adding error handling i.e. a try catch block.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We should also add some middleware that can limit the rate at which requests ping the server. If we are expecting a large amount of requests, and do not want to filter out legitimate traffic, we can implement a human check, like a recaptcha.
