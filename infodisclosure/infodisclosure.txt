Which CIA property does tampering violate?
This violates the property of confidentiality because it enables the disclosure of potentially sensitive information.
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
We can incorporate an authentication service in order to prevent such attacks. We can also ensure we sanitize all inputs as another line of defense.
